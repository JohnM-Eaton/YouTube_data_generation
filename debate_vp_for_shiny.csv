CBS News,10/8/2020,"Watch full 2020 VP debate: Mike Pence, Kamala Harris face off in Utah","Vice President Mike Pence and Senator Kamala Harris met for the first and only vice presidential debate of the 2020 campaign in Salt Lake City, Utah, with sharp exchanges over the coronavirus pandemic, the economy, the Supreme Court and more. 

Harris and Pence traded accusations over the federal response to the pandemic that has claimed the lives of more than 210,000 Americans, with Harris harshly criticizing the administration's record. President Trump tested positive for the coronavirus just six days ago.

""The American people have witnessed what is the greatest failure of any presidential administration in the history of our country,"" Harris said, with Pence sitting 12 feet away from her, separated by two panes of plexiglass as protection against the virus.

Pence, who again tested negative for the coronavirus earlier in the day, defended the administration's response and said the president's moves in the early days of the pandemic saved lives.

USA Today's Susan Page moderated the vice presidential debate. The next debate between Mr. Trump and Democratic nominee Joe Biden is scheduled for Thursday, Oct. 15 in Miami and will be moderated by C-SPAN's Steve Scully.
